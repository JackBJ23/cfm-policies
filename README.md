This repository contains code, scripts, and experiments for training and evaluating **CFM-based policies**, as well as **Diffusion Policy** built on top of the ManiSkill simulation framework. It includes utilities for dataset creation, training, evaluation, and plotting, as well as modified versions of ManiSkill baseline scripts.

## Contents
- `ManiSkill/` — main source code and experiment scripts  
- Training + evaluation scripts (CFM, RF, DP, and variants)  
- Plotting utilities for straightness, energy, and other metrics  
- Helper scripts for dataset generation and running experiments

## Usage
Clone the repository:
```bash

```

## Note

Due to the initial configuration of the repository, some .sh files show paths to some folders (e.g., datasets, checkpoints)
 that should be changed based on the true full paths of these documents.
